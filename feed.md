### Events
This is the events feed page. For the moment, this is all the detail we have about our events, so there are no further detail pages about these events. 

If we get more details â€“ or lots more events that we want to break up differently, all we have to do is the events data, name, and template information into _config.yaml and we'll get a full set of pages that we can use and link to just like the Catalogue Items and People pages. 

Worth noting: even though we haven't created pages, the data from our spreadsheet entries is still available via the site.data.feed array.
