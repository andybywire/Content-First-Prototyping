### Directory
Here's a landing page for the directory pages. As with the Catalogue page, this page is pulling data from the _data spreadsheet (in the _data file). There is a starter set of attributes associated with the directory content type, but you should feel free to add any that are useful for your users – for example, maybe the people you represent here have specialty, or their certifications are important. Just add a column in the spreadsheet, populate it, then call the data in your template. Voilá!
