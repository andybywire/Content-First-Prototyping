### Catalogue
This is the catalogue landing page. This might be a description of the kinds of items or services your project offers. Maybe you'll want to toss a picture in there. I've just put a placeholder in for this starter kit, but when building out an actual conent first prototype, you'd want to be sure that the images you use are the ones that will actually accompany the rest of your content (because images are content!).

Just down below, you see the full list of catalogue items as we've established in the _data spreadsheet. The representation is different from what you saw on the home page, but remember: all of the data is coming from the same place. Update a label, or some text, or an image here, and it will update everywhere else that it is shows.
